# 103cipher
Project 103cipher for B1 - Mathematics at Epitech

Project done in duo with Guilian Ganster @zoraneus

Goal of the project:

You have to carry out such a matrix-based ciphering software, using the following process to encrypt :

•Transcript the key into numbers using the ASCII table,

•Convert the numbered key into a square matrix, the smallest possible size, and filling the lines first,

•Transcript the clear message into numbers using the ASCII table,

•Convert the numbered message into a matrix; its number of columns should fit the key matrix size,
and its number of lines should be as small as possible,

•Multiply the 2 matrices, and write the answer linearly to get the encrypted message

The decryption process logically follows from the previous encryption method, using the same key (be
careful! You need to inverse the key matrix, which is not always possible).
